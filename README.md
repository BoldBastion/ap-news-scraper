# AP News Scraper

## What It Does

AP News Scraper is a powerful web scraping tool designed to extract and organize data from websites at scale. This actor automatically collects extracts breaking news articles from associated press, processing large volumes of data efficiently while respecting server resources and terms of service. Whether you're building a competitive intelligence system, training machine learning models, or aggregating industry data, this tool provides reliable, structured output ready for immediate analysis.

## Who Uses This Actor

AP News Scraper serves a diverse range of professionals and organizations. Media monitoring, pr agencies, news aggregators rely on this tool daily to gather intelligence, monitor trends, and make data-driven decisions. Product managers use it to track competitor offerings, researchers leverage it for dataset creation, and business analysts depend on it for market research. The actor has become indispensable for anyone who needs to scale their data collection efforts without maintaining complex infrastructure.

## What You Get Back

When you run this actor, you receive structured, clean data ready for immediate use. The output includes comprehensive fields that capture the most valuable information from each source. All data is returned in JSON format, making it trivial to integrate with your existing tools, databases, and workflows. The structured format means you can immediately filter, sort, and analyze results without extensive preprocessing or data cleaning.

## How It Compares to Alternatives

Many teams attempt to build web scraping solutions in-house, but this approach is costly and time-consuming. Maintaining scrapers requires constant updates as websites change their structure, handling at scale requires distributed infrastructure, and managing IP blocking and proxy rotation becomes a full-time job. This actor eliminates those problems entirely. Unlike generic scraping libraries that require coding expertise, this solution works out of the box. Compared to other scraping APIs, AP News Scraper delivers superior performance with faster turnaround times and more flexible output options.

## Sample Output

Here's an example of the clean, structured JSON data you'll receive:

```
{
  "url": "https://example.com/page",
  "title": "Page Title",
  "content": "Extracted data",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "status": "success"
}
```

## Use Cases

Content marketers and SEO agencies use this actor to analyze competitor content, identify content gaps, and gather inspiration for their editorial calendars. Marketing professionals leverage it to monitor keyword rankings and track how competitors structure their content. Researchers and data scientists scrape websites to build training datasets for natural language processing and other AI applications. This actor provides clean, labeled data at a fraction of the cost of manual collection.

Business analysts use it to monitor competitor pricing, features, and marketing messages. This real-time competitive intelligence enables faster decision-making and more aggressive go-to-market strategies. News aggregators, review sites, and vertical search engines depend on scrapers to gather information from diverse sources and present unified views to their users. Real estate and e-commerce professionals use scrapers to track inventory changes, price movements, and competitive positioning across marketplaces.

## Pricing

AP News Scraper uses a simple, transparent pricing model with no hidden fees. The cost is $3 per 1K articles. For example, if you process 10,000 items, your cost would be $30.0. If you run 100,000 items monthly, you're looking at approximately $300.0 per month. This pricing is dramatically cheaper than building and maintaining in-house scraping infrastructure or hiring engineers to manage the problem.
